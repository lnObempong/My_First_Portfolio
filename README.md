# My First Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio project repository. This repository contains the source code for my first personal portfolio webpage, built as part of a web development assignment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a clean, well-structured, and semantic personal portfolio webpage using HTML5. The webpage showcases my skills, projects, background, and contact information.

## Repository Structure

- **portfolio/**  
  Contains the main webpage files.  
  - `index.html` â€” The homepage of the portfolio with sections such as Introduction, Projects, About Me, and Contact.

## Features

- Uses semantic HTML5 elements including `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.
- Navigation bar with links to different sections within the page.
- Dedicated sections highlighting:
  - **Introduction:** Brief description of myself.
  - **Projects:** Showcases my projects with links to live demos or repositories.
  - **About Me:** Background, skills, and interests.
  - **Contact:** Email and social media links with accessible mailto and external links.

## How to View

You can view the webpage by opening the `portfolio/index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Future Improvements

- Add CSS styling to improve the visual appeal and responsiveness.
- Include additional projects as I build more web development skills.
- Integrate JavaScript for enhanced interactivity.
